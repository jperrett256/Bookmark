# Bookmark

An extension for saving scroll positions.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Within `popup`:
	- Create `resources` directory, add latest version of [jQuery](https://jquery.com/download/)
	- Create `fonts` directory, add [Monsterrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) fonts
3. Package everything in a zip file (with no compression)

The packaged extension can now be signed and used.

## Notes
